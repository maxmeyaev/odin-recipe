            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the custard– Beat eggs and sugar in a bowl. Then add flour and milk. Beat just until incorporated. Then slowly pour 3 cups of hot milk into the egg mixture, while stirring quickly.</li>
                <li>Add remaining ingredients to pastry cream– Transfer to the cooktop and continue cooking over low heat until it thickens. Let the napoleon custard cool completely, then add the thawed cool whip and vanilla extract. Beat softened butter separately then fold it into the custard.</li>
                <li>Bake 6 puff pastry sheets– Bake them until they’re golden brown and let them cool. Reserve 1 baked sheet and crumble it up. Layer the cream and cooled pastry sheets, then coat the top and sides with the crumbled one.</li>
